In this project, I perform portfolio optimization based on sentiment analysis using the BERT language model. The sentiment analysis serves as an additional constraint within the classical Markowitz portfolio optimization framework. The objective function aims to maximize the return-to-risk ratio. For this purpose, I utilized the PyPortfolioOpt and transformers libraries.
